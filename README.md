# Health Data Analysis

Since Februrary 2020, I have collected data from my Apple Watch (tracking cardio workouts, heart rate, steps), the Apple Health App (tracking blood pressure, weight), MyFitnessPal (tracking caloric, macronutrient, and micronutrient intake), Strong (tracking lifting progression). I am curious to analyze this data to understand patterns that will help me reach my fitness goals.
